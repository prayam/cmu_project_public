- insert a arbitrary id/password to DB
	1. we recognized the sqlite3 DB is used by checking the install guide.
	2. And we found the DB file and we could see the contents of the user DB.
	3. it consists of the user id and the hashed value of password.
	4. So we looked into the source code and we found the logic of how to make the hashed value of password.
	5. So we changed the password of the 'admin' in DB to what we generated.
	6. Finally we could do the login with 'admin' id with the generated password.
